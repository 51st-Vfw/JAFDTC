JAFDTC supports configuration of the following systems in the Mirage,

* Waypoints

Each of these areas is covered in more depth below. See the
[user's guide](https://github.com/51st-Vfw/JAFDTC/tree/master/doc)
for more on the aspects of JAFDTC that are common to multiple airframes.

# Configurable Systems

A Mirage configuration supports settings spanning one system as described below. All systems
implement the link and reset functionality mentioned in the overview of the
[system editor page](https://github.com/51st-Vfw/JAFDTC/tree/master/doc/README.md#system-editor-page).

Priort to uploading a configuration to the jet, you should ensure the relevant systems are
powered up and functional. Typically, uploads should occur as one of the last steps prior to
taxi once you have systems powered up, stores loaded, and so on.

## Waypoints

JAFDTC uses the common
[navigation system](https://github.com/51st-Vfw/JAFDTC/tree/master/doc/README.md#navigation-system-editors)
interface to set up the Mirage *Waypoint* system. Waypoints in the Mirage include DDM (degrees,
decimal minutes) formatted latitude and longitude and elevation.

# DCS Cockpit Integration

The Mirage does not map any cockpit controls to JAFDTC functions.
