JAFDTC supports configuration of the following systems in the Warthog,

* Waypoints

Each of these areas is covered in more depth below. See the
[user's guide](https://github.com/51st-Vfw/JAFDTC/tree/master/doc)
for more on the aspects of JAFDTC that are common to multiple airframes.

> JAFDTC does not support the legacy DCS A-10C module.

# Configurable Systems

A Warthog configuration supports settings spanning one system as described below. All systems
implement the link and reset functionality mentioned in the overview of the
[system editor page](https://github.com/51st-Vfw/JAFDTC/tree/master/doc/README.md#system-editor-page).

Priort to uploading, you should ensure the relevant systems are powered up and functional.
Typically, uploads should occur as one of the last steps prior to taxi once you have systems
powered up, stores loaded, and so on.

## Waypoints

JAFDTC uses the common
[navigation system](https://github.com/51st-Vfw/JAFDTC/tree/master/doc/README.md#navigation-system-editors)
interface to set up the Warthog *Waypoint* system. Waypoints in the Warthog include DDM
(degrees, decimal minutes) formatted latitude and longitude and elevation.

# DCS Cockpit Integration

The Warthog does not map any cockpit controls to JAFDTC functions.
