# Configurable Systems

A Strike Eagle configuration supports settings spanning three systems as described below. Each
of these systems implements the link and reset functionality mentioned in the overview of the
[system editor page](https://github.com/51st-Vfw/JAFDTC/tree/master/doc/README.md#system-editor-page).

Priort to uploading, you should ensure the relevant systems are powered up and functional.
Typically, uploads should occur as one of the last steps prior to taxi once you have systems
powered up, stores loaded, and so on.
