# JAFDTC: Configuring F/A-18C Hornet Airframes

*Version 1.0.0-B.21 of 28-Jan-24*

JAFDTC supports configuration of the following systems in the Hornet,

* Communications
* Countermeasures
* Waypoints

Each of these areas is covered in more depth below. See the
[user's guide](https://github.com/51st-Vfw/JAFDTC/tree/master/doc)
for more on the aspects of JAFDTC that are common to multiple airframes.

# Configurable Systems

A Hornet configuration supports settings spanning two systems as described below. Each of
these systems implements the link and reset functionality mentioned in the overview of
the
[system editor page](https://github.com/51st-Vfw/JAFDTC/tree/master/doc/README.md#system-editor-page).

Priort to uploading, you should ensure the relevant systems are powered up and functional.
Typically, uploads should occur as one of the last steps prior to taxi once you have systems
powered up, stores loaded, and so on.
