# JAFDTC: F/A-18C Hornet Configurations

*Version 1.0.0 of TODO*

JAFDTC supports the following configuration in the Hornet,

* CMS countermeasures system
* WYPT waypoint system
* COM1/COM2 radio presets and initial configuration

Each of these areas is covered in more depth below. See the
[user's guide](https://github.com/51st-Vfw/JAFDTC/tree/master/doc)
for more on the aspects of JAFDTC that are common to multiple airframes.

# Configurable Systems

A Hornet configuration supports settings spanning two systems as described below. Each of
these systems implements the link and reset functionality mentioned in the overview of
the
[system editor page](https://github.com/51st-Vfw/JAFDTC/tree/master/doc/README.md#system-editor-page).

Priort to uploading, you should ensure the relevant systems are powered up and functional.
Typically, uploads should occur as one of the last steps prior to taxi once you have systems
powered up, stores loaded, and so on.
